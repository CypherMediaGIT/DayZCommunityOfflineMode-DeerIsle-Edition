**Thank you to Arkensor for his Mod DayZCommunityOffline Mode**
**For without his Mod this would not exsit**  

The DayZ Community Offline Mode DeerIsle Edition offers the ability, to explore the world of DayZ in a singleplayer environment on the DeerIsle Map. While this mode does not represent the actual DayZ gameplay it offers other possibilites for developers, content creators and player who do want to experiment around but not loose all their progress from online.

# This Version contains [DayZED](https://deerisle-wiki.jimdosite.com/dayzed/)

DayZED is a free tool which JohnMcLane coded for himself while modding on the map - to make some things just easier and quicker. Its main purpose is to do massive database changes at once with just a few clicks. Aka "Loot Editor". 

# DayZED Known issues

Please keep in mind, its a very early and maybe buggy version. Some core features like deleting player- or eventspawns are still missing and will come in future updates. You can also use DayZED for editing Chernarus.

This is UNOFFICIAL, so don't blame the DayZ development team if this is not working at all for you!

# Saving and Loading of Custom Buildings
After you placed down all objects you want to add, press ```SAVE``` in the Object Info panel. You can do this at any given time to ensure you don't loose your progress. This will be saved to a file located at C:\Users\YOURNAME\Documents\DayZ Labled as COMObjectEditorDeerIsleSave.json
To export the objects simply press the ```EXPORT``` button. Now all placed objects will be exported and the code you need will be copied to your clipboard, which you can now paste into your .c File.

# Installation:
To Download ```DeerIsle``` please visit the steam store https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1602372402 and click on Subscribe and wait for steam to download the Workshop content, Once installed Run DayZ via Steam by clicking play on the DayZ page from within your game libary, when the Steam DayZ Launcher screen shows, Click on Mods on the menu to the left, Find ```DeerIsle``` in your mods List and click the drop down box arrow to the right of the DeerIsle line, Click the 3 dotted line to ```"Display More Options"``` and select "Open Folder in Windows Explorer", Click "I understand" in the next window, now copy ```@DeerIsle``` folder, press up one level in your current folder and paste the ```@DeerIsle``` into the DayZ folder that you should now be in ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\DayZ```

You might delete your whole ```Missions``` folder and validate your game files via steam to get the original DayZ files back.
