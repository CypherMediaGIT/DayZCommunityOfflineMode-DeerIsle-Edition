This Version of DeeIsle Offline Mode contains DayZED
DayZED is a free tool which JohnMcLane coded for himself while modding on the map - to make some things just easier and quicker. Its main purpose is to do massive database changes at once with just a few clicks. Aka "Loot Editor".
This version has bugs and will not be updated, you have to be a patreon of Benni's to get the updated DayZed Tool.

DayZED Known issues
Please keep in mind, its a very early and maybe buggy version. Some core features like deleting player- or eventspawns are still missing and will come in future updates. You can also use DayZED for editing Chernarus.

This is UNOFFICIAL, so don't blame the DayZ development team if this is not working at all for you!
